#I made this script to convert any amount from one currency to another using current exchange rates from the exchangerate-api.

import requests

def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):
    url = f"https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{from_currency}"
    data = requests.get(url).json()
    return amount * data["rates"][to_currency]

amount = 50
from_currency = "USD"
to_currency = "EUR"
result = convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)
print(f"{amount} {from_currency} is equivalent to {result} {to_currency}")
